ðŸ“Œ Java Interview Questions with Answers
ðŸ”¹ Basic Level

Q1. What is Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Java is a high-level, object-oriented, platform-independent programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now Oracle). It follows the WORA (Write Once, Run Anywhere) principle because of the JVM.


Q2. What is JVM, JRE, and JDK?
JVM (Java Virtual Machine): Executes Java bytecode.
JRE (Java Runtime Environment): JVM + Libraries required to run Java programs.
JDK (Java Development Kit): JRE + Development tools (compiler, debugger).


Q3. What are the main features of Java?
Object-Oriented
Platform Independent
Robust & Secure
Multithreaded
Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection)


Q4. Difference between == and equals() in Java?
== â†’ compares references (memory addresses).
equals() â†’ compares content (overridden in classes like String).


Q5. What are primitive data types in Java?
ðŸ‘‰ byte, short, int, long, float, double, char, boolean.
ðŸ”¹ OOPs Concepts


Q6. What are the 4 main OOPs principles in Java?
Encapsulation â†’ Wrapping data & methods in a class.
Inheritance â†’ Acquiring properties of a parent class.
Polymorphism â†’ Method Overloading & Overriding.
Abstraction â†’ Hiding implementation using abstract classes & interfaces.


Q7. Difference between abstract class and interface?
Abstract Class: Can have abstract + concrete methods, supports inheritance.
Interface: Only abstract methods (Java 8+ allows default & static methods), supports multiple inheritance.


Q8. What is method overloading vs method overriding?
Overloading: Same method name, different parameter list (compile-time).
Overriding: Subclass provides specific implementation of superclass method (runtime).


ðŸ”¹ Intermediate
Q9. What is String immutability in Java?
ðŸ‘‰ String objects are immutable (cannot be changed once created).
If modified, a new object is created.



Q10. Difference between String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer?
String: Immutable.
StringBuilder: Mutable, not thread-safe.
StringBuffer: Mutable, thread-safe (synchronized).


Q11. What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?
ArrayList: Uses dynamic array, faster for random access, slower for insertion/deletion.
LinkedList: Uses doubly linked list, faster for insertion/deletion, slower for random access.


Q12. What is HashMap in Java?
ðŸ‘‰ HashMap stores key-value pairs.
Keys must be unique.
Allows one null key and multiple null values.
Uses hashing for fast lookup.


Q13. Difference between HashMap and Hashtable?
HashMap: Not synchronized, allows null key, better performance.
Hashtable: Synchronized, no null key, thread-safe.



ðŸ”¹ Advanced
Q14. What is multithreading in Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Multithreading allows concurrent execution of multiple threads.
Achieved by extending Thread class or implementing Runnable interface.


Q15. What is the difference between process and thread?
Process: Independent execution unit with its own memory space.
Thread: Lightweight execution unit within a process, shares memory.


Q16. What is synchronization in Java?
ðŸ‘‰ Synchronization ensures that only one thread can access a resource at a time.
Used to avoid race conditions.

Q17. Explain Garbage Collection in Java.
ðŸ‘‰ Java automatically removes unused objects from memory.
Uses mark and sweep algorithm.
Can be triggered manually with System.gc() (not guaranteed).


Q18. What are Checked and Unchecked exceptions?
Checked: Checked at compile-time (e.g., IOException, SQLException).
Unchecked: Occur at runtime (e.g., NullPointerException, ArithmeticException).


Q19. What is the difference between final, finally, and finalize()?
final: Keyword (constant variables, prevent inheritance, prevent overriding).

finally: Block in exception handling (always executes).

finalize(): Method called by GC before destroying object.

Q20. What is the difference between Callable and Runnable?

Runnable: Does not return a result, cannot throw checked exception.

Callable: Returns a result (via Future), can throw exceptions.
